# PDF-Stamp-Identifier
This repository contains a Python script that uses the PyMuPDF library to identify potential stamps in a PDF document. The identified stamps are then visualized on the corresponding pages using OpenCV and Matplotlib. The goal is to assist in automating the detection of stamps within PDF files.
